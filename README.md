# meme-generator-2015
[//]: # (Description)
Created in 2015 during my web programming studies, this meme generator allows users to customize text, color, size, and position. Developed with HTML, JS, CSS, and jQuery,the project remains untouched, exactly as I extracted it from the RAR file I've safeguarded since my days as a web application student.
